A detailed step-by-step instruction is provided below as well:
1. Download PARSNIP.py
2. Run PARSNIP.py in a Command Prompt with Administrator privileges using "Python PARSNIP.py" in the proper directory
3. Specify a hive file path (i.e. C:\Windows\System32\config\SAM)
4. Specify the CSV output entry limit
5. Parse by clicking "Refresh"
6. Click any column header (Key, Name, Value, Type) to sort the parsed keys accordingly
7. OPTIONAL: Set a time interval for automatic parsing mode and enable such

Note: 
- Every parsing and of a specified hive will output CSV files of its data.
- Changes detected will be listed and outputted if a prior parsing of a certain hive was already executed.
- CSV Outputs are named according to the system's (military) time and date for timelining purposes.
